Hello there  <i class="fas fa-bullhorn fa-flip-horizontal"></i>(°-°)ノ ┻━┻

My name is **Davide Nunes**, I'm a research scientist and musician based in Lisbon, Portugal. I’m building Artificial Intelligence systems for natural language understanding, developing machine learning algorithms, and philosophising about consciousness, intelligence, and autonomy.

I’m doing my PhD in computer science at the University of Lisbon, working in artificial intelligence at the Biosystems and Integrative Sciences Institute (BioISI). In the past I also published work in Agent-Based Modelling, Social Simulation, and Complex Social Networks.
