Welcome! This is a personal space where I express my opinions,
philosophical musings, occasional "news" about topics that interest me, 
updates on research activity, and enough of being captain obvious. 

More than anything, I enjoy maintaining control over my content somewhere,
especially when other third-party "web-identity" services invite you do invest
your time and your content without matching the commitment with an adequate
level of ownership and control. Content here might end up mirrored on other
services like Medium, that way, one can at least remain in control while not
feeling like a total digital hermit.
