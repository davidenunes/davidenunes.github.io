#Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation with NetLogo#
![]({{site.url}}/assets/resources/courses/netlogo/images/netlogo_banner.png)

#Summary#
[NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) is a multi-agent programmable modelling environment. It's a simple but expressive language used both by the academic community and enterprises to simulate natural and social phenomena. It is particularly adequate for propotyping complex and decentralised systems and has a very smooth learning curve which makes it ideal for education puposes. NetLogo allows one to explore the connections between micro (local) interactions between different agents and the macro patterns that emerge from such interaction. 

This introductory course is designed for begginers in the NetLogo platform. It offers hands-on-oriented material designed to help you develop core programming skills for the NetLogo platform. The course will teach you how to implement, analyse and debug agent-based simulation models. We will also explore how to design simulation experiments. This is a 2-day course divided into 7 sessions. On each session we tackle a particular aspect of designing simulation models in NetLogo and supply suplementary material in the form of slides and simulation models.
