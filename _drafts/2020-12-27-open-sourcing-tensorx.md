## TensorX

Google open sourcing TensorFlow coincided with the beginning of my research in representation learning for natural language expressions. Despite the first iterations of the library being far from user-friendly, adopting this framework has proven to be worth it. Even rudimentary neural network models can be quite computationally intensive, and being able to run them on GPU devices and distributed environments has considerably accelerated model training and evaluation, thus speeding up the iterative research pipeline. Having access to automatic differentiation was also a very attractive feature, as the focus could be put on higher-level aspects without worrying about low level derivative specifications.

While the above features were very attractive, I felt like standardized components were far from being available. The availability of well tested building blocks for neural network architectures would also increase my ability to iterate on ideas without spending so much time on implementation details and boilerplate code. The growing codebase I was developing for my research needs gave rise to a framework I called [TensorX](https://tensorx.org/).

% developed at the same time as keras

% google change to 2.x kind of delayed my plans of making this available

% while this change is easier for users more familiar with imperative %programming structure, the change kind of fucked me. Nevertheless I felt %like the previous code base could be adapted to provide a clear minimal %series of building blocks that could facilitate the building of neural %network even more

% roadmap ? examples etc
