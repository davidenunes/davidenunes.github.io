title: Webpage Redesign with Jekyll
comments: True

I redesigned my website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). This two-column theme is inspired by [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) with an added profile picture, sidebar background image, and a slightly different color scheme and fonts.

{% highlight js %}
// This is a comment in Javascript
var adder = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");

// Call the function
adder(2, 6);
// > 8
{% endhighlight %}


**$$ \LaTeX $$** rendering is supported through [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/):
\\[ 
    \sigma(z)_j = \frac{ e^z_j }{\sum^K _\{k=1\} e^{ \beta z_k}} 
\\]
