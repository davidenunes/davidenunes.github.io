The book [The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual
Emancipation](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/445408.The_Ignorant_Schoolmaster)
(1987), by the French philosopher Jacques Rancière, presents the notion of
_intellectual emancipation_; the idea of _equality of the mind_. The book most
striking arguments are made around our assumed biases towards competition and
inequality. The things that transpire the most from our social fabric.

>"The impossibility of our saying the truth, even when we feel it, makes us

>nothing, doing is everything, but this doing is fundamentally an act of
>communication."

My cynicism resonates  with the following:  

>"There is no pride in saying out loud: Me too, I’m a painter! Pride consists in
>saying softly to others: You neither, you aren’t a painter! "Me too, I’m a
>painter” means: me too, I have a feelings to communicate to my fellow men."

>"One must learn near those who have worked in the gap between feeling and
>expression , between the silent language of emotion and the arbitrariness of
>the spoken tongue, near those who have tried to give voice to the silent
>dialogue the soul has with itself, who have gambled all their credibility on
>the bet of the similarity of minds."

A recurrent message is that "he  who knows how to remain true to himself in the
middle of irrationality  will triumph over  the  passions  of others  exactly as
he triumphs over his own." which takes me back to
[stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) and Marcus Aurelius'
_Meditations_:

>"The happiness of those who want to be popular depends on others; the happiness
>of those who seek pleasure fluctuates with moods outside their control; but the
>happiness of the wise grows out of their own free acts."

Rancière's _emancipation_, much like stoicism, falls back to reason above all
else as a way to deal with our innate biases. Reason (and the awareness to
reason) is perhaps the way to avoid "falling into the gravitational field of
other minds". 

Another recurrent theme is a critique of theories of pedagogical reform.
Theories that present themselves as an attempt to reform the social inequities
of the school system without realizing that school is not a preparation for
life, but a reflection that models it's stratification.

Rancière’s critique of the educational  theories of Bourdieu, Althusser, and
Milner shows them to have at least one thing in common: a lesson in inequality.
Each, that is, by beginning with  inequality, proves it, and by proving it, in
the end, is obliged to rediscover it again and again. Whether school is seen as
the reproduction of inequality (Bourdieu) or as the potential instrument for the
reduction of inequality (Savary), the effect is the same: that of erecting and
maintaining the distance separating a future reconciliation from a present
inequality, a knowledge in the offing from today’s intellectual impoverishment
&mdash;a distance discursively invented and reinvented so that it may never be
abolished
