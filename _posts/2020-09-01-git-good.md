Git is a free and open source distributed Version Control System (VCS). Git can
be hard, especially for people discovering it for the first time, but there are
a lot of things that make this an exceptional VCS worth learning. This post is
not meant to be a git tutorial, but rather a compilation of things and tips I
find interesting. I also wanted to give a perspective of git independent of
services like GitHub. Hopefully you can find something useful and "_git better
at it_" üôÉ.

If you're looking to learn how to use git, take a look at the [Pro Git
book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/), it's free and it is a great resource!

## Git is not GitHub üòÆ

Services like [GitHub](https://github.com) made git particularly popular, but
the convenience of something like Github has its downsides for new users: it
causes confusion about the differences between [GitHub](https://github.com) or
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), and the actual version control system, _git_.
While the former are great to host git repositories and make them publicly
available (among other things), git is a piece of software designed to allow for
distributed version control and collaboration. This means that you can use it
offline, without GitHub, you can collaborate with people via chat, email, and
anything that allows you to send text to someone else. Yes, GitHub makes it
convenient to host your project and make it discoverable; it provides an
incentive for collaboration, but, at the end of the day, GitHub is not git, just
as Gmail is not e-mail.

## Git is distributed üñß

For those used to GitHub, collaborating with git over e-mail might seem
anachronistic, but, consider the scale of projects and what git was designed to
do. Being able to send contributions as plain text allied with the threaded
nature of e-mail, means that you can have multiple discussions around certain
aspects of a contribution, which is a big plus. Linux kernel development, for
example, doesn't happen on GitHub or GitLab. From the linux kernel GitHub Pull
requests (GitHub's system for submitting contributions):

> Thanks for your contribution to the Linux kernel!
>
> Linux kernel development happens on mailing lists, rather than on GitHub -
> this GitHub repository is a read-only mirror that isn't used for accepting
> contributions. So that your change can become part of Linux, please email it
> to us as a patch.
>
> Sending patches isn't quite as simple as sending a pull request, but
> fortunately it is a well documented process.
>
> Here's what to do:
>
> * Format your contribution according to kernel requirements
> * Decide who to send your contribution to
> * Set up your system to send your contribution as an email
> * Send your contribution and wait for feedback

The development happens on various mailing lists for multiple subsystems. It's
distributed development to an unprecedented scale. This scale has a price,
discipline in your contributions, something that GitHub doesn't really help
reinforce --which seems to be the whole
[issue](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5654674) that the
creator of git Linus Torvalds has with it.

### Git daemon üåê

Focusing the development on a centralised service like GitHub can feel like
you're using an improved version of Subversion client/server approach, but
remember, git is truly a decentralized system and we can do better. Suppose you
don't want to use GitHub, but want to make your repository available for other
people to clone, pull from, etc. Git supports Peer-to-Peer setup out of the box
with [`git
daemon`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Git-Daemon).
Collaboration then happens on each peer local copy of the source tree and some
form of communication channel (e.g. e-mail, chat, etc).

From your git folder you can execute the following command

```bash
git daemon --export-all --base-path=. --reuseaddr
```

* `--enable=upload-pack`: (enabled by default) allows for `git fetch`, `git pull`, and `git clone`.
* `--export-all`: means that you don‚Äôt have to create a file named git-daemon-export-ok in each exported repository.
* `--base-path`: allows people to clone projects without specifying the entire
  path. Example: if you start the daemon with `--base-path=/srv/git` and try to
  pull from `git://example.com/hello.git`, git daemon will interpret the path as
  `/srv/git/hello.git`.
* `--reuseaddr`: allows the server to restart without waiting for old connections to time out.

Congratulations, your machine is now running a git server and anyone can do:

```bash
git clone git://192.168.1.42/  #Your IP
# or
git remote add Foo git://192.168.1.42/
git fetch Foo
git checkout develop
git push Foo develop
```

### Git patches üìù

As we have discussed, git is a decentralized system, you can send contributions
to anyone without the need of a centralized git repository. This is not only the
default way of collaborating with git, it is particularly useful when a server
is down, or if you don't have permissions to write to a remote repository
&mdash;but would still like to propose changes.

You can create a patch from your current changes without committing the code on
your source tree:

```bash
# changes in the working tree not yet staged for commit
git diff > big-improvements.patch
# or changes between the index and your last commit;
# what you would be committing if you run "git commit"
# without "-a" option.
git diff --cached > big-improvements.patch
```

As an example suppose the change is the addition of a README file, the diff
would look like this:

```diff
diff --git a/README b/README
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..e69de29
```

More often, what we would like to do is to propose a change we have made in your
local source tree. To do this, we can use the [`git
format-patch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch) command:

```bash
git format-patch master
```

if we have commits ahead of the master branch, a diff file will be generated. We can also reference other commits in the same branch.
Suppose we made changes in the current branch and want to reference the changes in relation to the last commit. We can do:

```bash
git format-patch HEAD~1
```

the patch file will contain something like:

```diff
From daf1010eb425a67ca6b0ba60f7cbec15bcff31f1 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: John Doe <heresjohnny@bestmail.com>
Date: Tue, 09 Sep 2020 15:42:00 +0100
Subject: [PATCH] Update README

---
 README | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

diff --git a/README b/README
index e69de29..d0fc019 100644
--- a/README
+++ b/README
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+This is a README file, that is all.
--
2.28.0
```

to apply the patch we do:

```bash
# patch as unstaged changes in your branch
git apply 0001-Update-README.patch

# patch as commits
git am 0001-Update-README.patch
```

For more information, check the documentation for [`git
diff`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff), [`git
format-patch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch), [`git
apply`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-apply), and [`git
am`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-am).

### git request-pull ‚úâÔ∏è

Git comes with its own [pull request
module](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull).

This feature has nothing to do with [GitHubs pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request).
It's mean to facilitate the creation of summary messages to be sent through
e-mail for example. If you want to use GitHubs pull request feature without the
web interface, check out the [hub](https://hub.github.com/) command line interface tool.
{: .notice--danger}

Imagine that you built your work on your master branch on top of the v1.0
release, and want it to be integrated to the project. First you push that change
to your public repository for others to see. If this is a remote repository you might do it like this:

```bash
git push https://bestgitserver.com/project master
```

Then we run the following command:

```bash
git request-pull v1.0 https://bestgitserver.com/project master
```

This will produce a request message with information about:

 1. where to pull from (your downstream repository address)
 2. the upstream repository
 3. a summary of the changes between v1.0 release and your master.

You can then send this request by e-mail for instance, making the pull request
completely distributed and independent from GitHub proprietary system.

## Git tips üî•

We are all bound to get stuck sometimes when things go wrong. A good starting
point is this [compilation](https://ohshitgit.com/). These are solutions to
problems I often have to solve.

### Premature commit üîß

You pulled the trigger too fast on that commit and wish you could include
additional changes? Make your changes, call `git commit --amend` and done. (Also
useful to change the commit message.)

### Go back ‚åõ

We messed up, go back to a previous commit.

```bash
# go back n commits n=1 in this case,
# --soft: optionally don't discard changes
# and put them on the staging area instead
git reset HEAD~1 --soft
```

### Put changes on hold üöß

So you want to get back to the state before you started making changes, but
don't want to throw these changes away:

```bash
# stash the changes
git stash
# get the changes back when needed
git stash pop
```

### Where it went wrong üîç

You have a problem and don't know which commit introduced it, enter [`git bisect`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect):

```bash
git bisect start          # start a bisect section
git bisect bad            # Current version is bad
git bisect good v2.2.1    # v2.2.1 is known to be good
```

bisect will now choose commits in the middle of the history and you can mark
them as good or bad with the same commands. When no more revisions are available
you'll have a description of the commit that caused the problem. You can then reset
the bisect state with `git bisect reset`.

### Rebasing commits üí•

Sometimes we make two commits when in reality, we could have included all the
changes in a single commit, and our history would be clearer. This is what is
known as _squashing_. We can use `git rebase` to meld commits with previous
commits. It can also be used instead of merging branches. Git‚Äôs rebase command
temporarily rewinds the commits on your current branch, pulls in the commits
from the other reference and reapplies the re-winded commits back on top.

Most people will advise you to always squash the commits and rebase them onto
the parent branch (like master or develop) before you submit a pull request or
send out a patch. Whether rebasing is preferred to merging really depends on the
context.

If you want to read more about `rebase` vs `merge`, check out [this
post](https://medium.com/hackernoon/mastering-git-why-rebase-is-amazing-a954485b128a)
{: .notice--primary}

Whatever you do **DO NOT** rebase commits in a upstream repository people can
pull from. It will mess everyone's history and lead to conflicts that all
downstream peers will need to fix.
Also, it's **never** a good idea to **rebase somebody else's work**, see [this
discussion](https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/git_rebase.html).
{:.notice--danger}

```bash
# rebase last 2 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~2
```

The interactive system will open an editor where you can choose each commit in a
list that are about to be changed. In this case, it will list 2 lines with the
last 2 commits. This list reflects exactly how your branch will look like after
the rebase:

```bash
pick c8175df added line
pick dc58443 added final line

# Rebase 65e38e0..dc58443 onto 65e38e0 (2 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# s, squash <commit> = meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard log message
# ...
```

You can pick, reorder or squash any commits you want to make for a more readable
history.

As we discussed, you can also rebase the current branch onto another

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase -i master
```

For more information about rebase see the [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase)
{: .notice--primary}

### Good commit messages üßê

Commit messages should be consistent across a project in terms of **style**,
**content**, and **metadata**. But some good rules are as follows:

1. the minimum is a single short descriptive line (e.g. less than 50 characters);
2. separate subject, body, other data, with blank lines;
3. include metadata such as references to commits that introduce problems being
   solved.
4. wrap the body to 72 characters.

A good one liner can be something like this

```text
Fix typos in the abstract
```

the form `<Verb> <Target> <Description>` is sometimes enough context to describe
a simple change.

A great way to learn what good commit messages look like is to study
repositories where this is done right. It is to no surprise that the [Linux
kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master) and
[git](https://github.com/git/git/commits/master) itself are good examples. There
are also plenty resources on the subject such as [How to Write a Git Commit
Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Good commit messages are an important collaboration tool. They are the best way
to communicate context about a change to a fellow developer, or to our future
selves. `git diff` will tell us what changed, the _WHAT_, but this added context
documents the _WHY_.

## Git for writing üë®‚Äçüíª

I have been experimenting with git for writing. The idea being that we can
benefit from using version control with our papers, lecture notes, blog posts,
etc. Suppose we are considering git to track changes in a scientific paper. We
can mark submissions with tags, use patches to incorporate changes from
collaborators, branches to work on revisions, git diff to visualize the changes,
etc.

Remember that git cares about meaningful lines, so the first thing to take into
account is that we should, at minimum hard wrap our lines at a given character
limit, **and/or** write each sentence on a different line. By using Markdown or
LaTex to write a document, we will be tempted to use the editor for soft word
wrapping. This can lead to huge one-line paragraphs. The problem with this is
that changing a word in that paragraph will be recorded as a change to the
entire paragraph. Moving lines around has a similar effect.

As a workaround, to visualise changes in such cases, we can use the
`--color-words` option with `git diff`.

Consider a LaTeX document, for example. If we move lines around and call the
following command:

```bash
git diff --color-words
```

this is what we get:
<figure>
  <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/git_diff_color_words.png">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/git_diff_color_words.png"></a>
</figure>

But what is actually recorded in the diff is the following:

<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/git_diff_lines_moved.png">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/git_diff_lines_moved.png"></a>
</figure>

To generate a pdf to visualise the changes in our tracked latex document, check
out the [git latexdiff](https://gitlab.com/git-latexdiff/git-latexdiff/) tool
that wraps around git and [latexdiff](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff).

The result of the following command is an output pdf with the changes in
relation with the previous commit

```bash
git latexdiff HEAD~1
```

<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/git_latexdiff.png">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/git_latexdiff.png"></a>
</figure>

## Archiving projects üèõÔ∏è

This is not related to git specifically, but more with good open science
practices. Online repository hosts like Github are not archival. Git itself lets
us tag commits to mark versions and releases, but tags can be deleted, and
storage is totally dependent on us. Remember, git distributed, and local. Git is
meant to track changes and collaborate, not archive the state of projects.

Platforms like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), on the other hand, let you
conveniently archive versions of GitHub repositories based on GitHub releases
(tags).

If you already use GitHub as a public accessible mirror for your project tracked
by git, this means you can easily archive certain versions of your project and
automatically make them citable since Zenodo attributes a Digital Object
Identifier (DOI) to its submissions.

With this said, we should discuss how to **archive**, **backup**, or **share**
your entire git repository **without depending on any specific platform**. There
are a couple of options. 
{: .notice--primary}

### You could zip it but... üóÑÔ∏è

A zip of your project folder will include EVERYTHING, yes, including your `.git`
folder with all the changes, branches,
[reflogs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog) but **this might not be what you
actually want**. A zip of the project folder will include untracked files, and
you could accidentally share sensitive information, irrelevant temporary files
or IDE and editor configuration folders, etc.

### Mirror clone üîó

A git clone with the option `--mirror` creates a bare repository (which contains
only the stuff in the .git directory) and it maps all refs (including
remote-tracking branches, etc.) to the target repository. This means that these
refs can be updated by a `git remote update`.

```bash
git clone --mirror myrepo repo.git
# or some remote repository
git clone --mirror https://github.com/davidenunes/repo repo.git
```

You could make a backup of your repository by creating a mirror (bare) repository and
archive it.

To restore the bare repository, you can do the following:

```bash
mkdir myrepo
mv repo.git myrepo/.git
cd myrepo
git init
git checkout -f
```

If you want to refresh the backup you just need to call `git remote update` from the clone location.
{: .notice--primary}

### Bundling üì¶

Git is capable of [bundling](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Bundling)
its data into a single binary file. You need to list out every reference or
specific range of commits that you want to be included. If you intend for this
to be cloned somewhere else, you should add `HEAD` as a reference as well.
Alternatively, you can use `--all` to include all refs.

Within the project folder do:

```bash
# this will include all info to recreate the master branch
git bundle create repo.bundle HEAD master
# optionally --all for all refs to be included
git bundle create repo.bundle --all
```

You can then send or store this file, and in another machine unbundle it into a repository:

```bash
git clone -b master repo.bundle repo
```

If you don't include the `HEAD` reference (or `--all`) you will get the
following error:`warning: remote HEAD refers to non-existent ref, unable to
checkout.`
{: .notice--warning}

Using `--all` makes your bundle file match what you would get with `git clone
--mirror`
