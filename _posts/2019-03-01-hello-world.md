It's that time of the year again, I decided to redesign my website. I'm starting fresh with Jekyll and Github pages. It gives me all the flexibility I could possibly need while not having to host the static site myself. I'm adapting the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. This theme has a lot of nice features (perhaps too many) but It's easy enough to customize to my needs.

I'll progressively migrate all my previous content here, including teaching material I created related to AI, data science, machine learning, philosophical rantings about consciousness and the direction of artificial intelligence research, and opinion pieces related to AI safety, bias, and other (most often) controvertial issues. Posts might include other interests besides my research work, it's a personal website after all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Some of the posts will probably be mirrored on Medium but I enjoy maintaining control over my content somewhere.
