Welcome to my space (hopefully not as dead as the social network). I enjoy
maintaining control over my content somewhere, especially when other third-party
"web-identity" services invite you to invest time and attention without matching
the commitment with adequate levels of ownership and control. I will post about
ongoing projects Artificial Intelligence in general, Natural Natural Language
Processing, Machine Learning in particular along with musings on the
philosophical aspects of intelligence, consciousness, and learning. More about
me [here]({{site.url}}/about).
