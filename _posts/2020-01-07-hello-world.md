Hello there. I know "hello world" posts might be redundant, but anyway, welcome to my little space. 
I enjoy maintaining control over my content somewhere, especially when other third-party 
"web-identity" services invite you to invest time and attention without matching the commitment 
with adequate levels of ownership and control. I will post about Artificial Intelligence in general, Natural
Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning in particular along with musings on the philosophical aspects 
of intelligence, consciousness, and learning. I feel this is the year I will start to write more in here and stop 
keeping all the juicy content to myself.
